/**
 * This module contains functions to help standardize the responses used to send back to ASK. The
 * constants are all functions, built by the `tmpl` tag function, documented below. They take
 * parameters and replace them with the data they are provided. Each index in the template string
 * corresponds to the parameter given. So `${1}` is the 2nd parameter when you execute the function.
 *
 * Responses that don't take any parameters are still functions, for the sake of consistency.
